## 4.0.0

### [#57](https://github.com/supabase-community/gotrue-csharp/pull/57) Refactor exceptions, code cleanup, and move to delegate auth state changes

Huge thank you to [@wiverson](https://github.com/wiverson) for his help on this refactor and release!

- Changes
    - Exceptions have been simplified to a single `GotrueException`. A `Reason` field has been added
      to `GotrueException` to clarify what happened. This should also be easier to manage as the Gotrue
      server API & messages evolve.
    - The session delegates for `Save`/`Load`/`Destroy` have been simplified to no longer require `async`.
    - Console logging in a few places (most notable the background refresh thread) has been removed
      in favor of a notification method. See `Client.AddDebugListener()` and the test cases for examples.
      This will allow you to implement your own logging strategy (write to temp file, console, user visible
      err console, etc).
    - The client now more reliably emits AuthState changes.
    - There is now a single source of truth for headers in the stateful Client - the `Options` headers.
- New feature:
    - Added a `Settings` request to the stateless API only - you can now query the server instance to
      determine if it's got the settings you need. This might allow for things like a visual
      component in a tool to verify the GoTrue settings are working correctly, or tests that run differently
      depending on the server configuration.
- Implementation notes:
    - Test cases have been added to help ensure reliability of auth state change notifications
      and persistence.
    - Persistence is now managed via the same notifications as auth state change

## 3.1.2 - 2023-05-02

- [#49](https://github.com/supabase-community/gotrue-csharp/issues/49) Implements `SignInWithOtp` for email and phone

## 3.1.1 - 2023-04-27

- Implements `SignInWithIdToken` for Apple/Google signing from LW7. A HUGE thank you
  to [@wiverson](https://github.com/wiverson)!

## 3.1.0 - 2023-04-08

- [Minor] Implements PKCE auth flow. SignIn using a provider now returns an instance of `ProviderAuthState` rather than
  a `string`.

## 3.0.6 - 2023-03-29

- Supports adding `SignInOptions` (i.e. `RedirectTo`) on `OAuth Provider` SignIn requests.

## 3.0.5 - 2023-02-28

- Fixes [#44](https://github.com/supabase-community/gotrue-csharp/issues/44) - refresh timer should automatically
  reattempt (interval of 5s) for HTTP exceptions - gracefully exits on invalid refresh and triggers
  an `AuthState.Changed` event

## 3.0.4 - 2023-01-18

- Makes `Session.CreatedAt` a publicly settable property, which should fix incorrect dates on retrieved `Session`s.

## 3.0.3 - 2022-11-12

- [Hotfix] Fixed `GetHeaders` not being passed to the `API` instance

## 3.0.2 - 2022-11-12

- Use `supabase-core` and implement `IGettableHeaders` on `IGotrueAPI` and `IGotrueClient`
- `Api` no longer requires `headers` as a parameter.

## 3.0.1 - 2022-11-11

- `ClientOptions` interface updated to support a generic `TSession` to match the `IGotrueClient` interface.

## 3.0.0 - 2022-11-4

- [#40](https://github.com/supabase-community/gotrue-csharp/pull/40) Adjust to Dependency Injection Structure (
  Thanks [@HunteRoi](https://github.com/HunteRoi))
- [#34](https://github.com/supabase-community/supabase-csharp/issues/34) Enable nullability in project.

Migration from 2.x.x to 3.x.x:

- `Client` is no longer a Singleton - it should be initialized using its standard constructor.
- `StatelessClient` is no longer `Static` - it should be initialized using a standard constructor.
- Setting/Retrieving state on init has been disabled by default, you will need to call `client.RetrieveSessionAsync()`
  to retrieve state from your `SessionRetriever` function.

## 2.4.7 - 2022-10-31

- [#41](https://github.com/supabase-community/gotrue-csharp/issues/41) Add support

- [#30](https://github.com/supabase-community/gotrue-csharp/pull/30) Update usage of `redirectTo` to reflect gotrue-js

## 2.4.1 - 2022-04-13

    - Fixes [#19](https://github.com/supabase-community/gotrue-csharp/issues/19)
    - Developers who were using a `null` check on `Session.User` will need to adjust accordingly.

## 2.3.2 - 2021-12-25

- Minor: `SignUp` signature now uses a class `SignUpOptions` to include `Data` and `RedirectTo` options. (
